# Work Day Scheduler
Written by Forrest Faulkner for Vanderbilt Full Stack Web Development course 2020

Uses Bootstrap CSS, MomentJS, and jQuery to create a schedule stored in localStorage which allows for scheduling your 9 to 5 work day and keeping track of your life. The day is separated into past present and future sections by color, where hours past are colored grey, the present hour is red, and the future hours are green.
